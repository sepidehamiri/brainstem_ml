# A machine learning approach for prediction of auditory brainstem response in patients after head and neck radiation therapy 
Objective: The current study aimed at assessing machine learning models based on radiomic features for predicting ototoxicity via auditory brainstem response in patients with radiation therapy of head and neck cancers.

Materials and Methods: Auditory brainstem response was performed in 50 patients with head and neck radiation therapy. Radiomic features were extracted from the brain stem in computed tomography images of the head to build a radiomic signature. Accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, Area Under Curve and mean cross-validation were used to evaluate 6 different machine learning models including Bernoulli Naive Bayes, Decision Tree, Gradient Boosting Decision Trees, K-Nearest Neighbor, Random Forest, and Support Vector Machine.

Results: 21 of 50 patients experienced ototoxicity. Total number of 140 radiomic features were extracted from the segmented area. Of the six machine learning models, random forest method with 88% accuracy had the best result.

Conclusion: Based on the machine learning approach, we have shown that radiomic features of the brainstem region can predict radiation ototoxicities.
